# MynaWallet Halo2 Circuits

This repository aims to create proofs which verifies the RSA signatures signed by Myna Card(Japan's ID Card).

## Getting Started

For a brief introduction to zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), see this [doc](https://docs.axiom.xyz/zero-knowledge-proofs/introduction-to-zk).

Halo 2 is written in Rust, so you need to [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Rust to use this library:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone this repo and start off in the `halo2-circuits` directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MynaWallet/halo2-circuits.git
cd halo2-circuits
```

## Run test

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench
```

# Usage
## For off-chain verification
### Create the directory where proofs are stored
```bash
mkdir -p build/app
```

### Generate the common reference string
```bash
cargo run app trusted-setup
```

### Generate pk & vk
```bash
cargo run app keys
```

### Generate a proof
```bash
cargo run app prove
```

### Run the verification code written in Rust
```bash
cargo run app verify
```

### Run the verification code written in Solidity
This fails because of the big proof size.
```bash
cargo run app evm
```

## For on-chain verification
Run `cargo run app keys` first.

### Create the directory where proofs are stored
```bash
mkdir -p build/agg
```

### Generate a proof that's ready to be aggregated
```bash
cargo run app snark
```

### Generate pk & vk
```bash
cargo run agg keys
```

### Generate a proof
```bash
cargo run agg prove
```

### Run the verification code written in Rust
```bash
cargo run agg verify
```

### Run the verification code written in Solidity
This succeeds because of the tiny proof size.
```bash
cargo run agg evm
```
